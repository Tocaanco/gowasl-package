# WAIntegration
simple laravel package to connect your whatsapp and send messages.


# Installation

Optionally you can use the Facade for shorter code. Add this to your facades: <br />

```
'Instance' => WAIntegration\Facades\InstanceFacade::class, 
'Message' => WAIntegration\Facades\MessageFacade::class, 
```
